                Welcome to our world, where code meets creativity! We're a group of young developers united by CSC 223. To us, Ruby on Rails is not just a tool for us; it became a journey of discovery and innovation. Join us as we continue to explore the endless possibilities with Ruby, curating a web application that is not only (somewhat) functional but also a joy (and growing story) to build.
